Your ideas must be concrete, shootable by solo creators, and optimized for attention hooks.

- Each idea must include:
  - `title`: 1 line, catchy, thumbnail/scroll-stopping.
  - `description`: 1–2 sentences, explaining the concept and value.
  - `hook`: 7–12 words, optimized for immediate audience attention.
- Ensure variety across formats (storytime, listicle, challenge, myth-busting, tutorial, POV, etc).
- Avoid generic clichés; every idea must feel fresh and feasible.
